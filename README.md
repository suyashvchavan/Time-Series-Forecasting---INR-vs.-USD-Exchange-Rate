__Time Series Analysis of Currency Valuation__<br>
In this study, valuation of the Indian National Rupee (INR) has been analyzed against the US Dollar (USD). The rupee has been struggling since Demonetization announce on 8th November,2016.On 1st January,2017 Indian Rupee stood at the value 68 against US Dollar.Today it is close to 74.5<br><br>
The concepts used in this analysis are regularly used in time series analysis. We begin by visualizing the obtained series. Various statistical properties of the series have been found out to explain the behavior of the series. Before moving on to building models, it is important to make the series behave like a stationary series. A stationary time series eliminates the effect of trend, seasonality and variance (any possible noise) on the final model.<br><br>
In an effort to make the series weakly stationary, various techniques have been tried. Each method has been analyzed statistically to find the series which behaves the most like a stationary series. After selecting the best method, the entire data series is transformed. Usually after this, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) are found to study any possible correlations with the lagged values of the series. Results from ACF and PACF are then piped into possible models studied for analysis.
